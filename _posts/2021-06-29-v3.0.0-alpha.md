Epispot v3.0.0 alpha is out, and we have a whole lot to talk about.

## New Plots
Epispot is getting new plots with plotly, and graph styling from science plots if you use matplotlib, not to mention a whole redesign of the plots module, which is now a sub-module, including the `epispot.plots.native` for native plots w/ matplotlib and `epispot.plots.web` for web-based interactive plotting w/ plotly.

## The CLI
We introduced this in the nightly package a while ago, and now it's here in the alpha of v3.0.0. 
```sh
epispot about 
```
Don't worry, `3.0.0` will have much more than just that command.

## With more coming soon...
As far as we are concerned, v3.0.0-alpha is only the start, with the beta, rc, and of course, _the 3.0 release_, you can expect bug fixes and more coming to epispot.
