As of 2/13/21, latest release being v2.0.1 of epispot published to both Anaconda and PyPI, and awaiting the release of v3.0.0, here is the epispot project roadmap:
<br><br>
It's February 13th, 2021 and epispot v3.0 is on the horizon. It's also one of those times when a very special document is released detailing a project roadmap that will
determine the fate of epispot forever. Our team has worked in 3 separate branches, pushed over 200 commits, merged plenty of pull requests, run the package more than a thousand
times, created over 8 repos on the epispot organization account, and worked countless hours to automate, deploy, manage, maintain, improve, expand, and deliver the epispot
package to over _five thousand_ installers. Our work doesn't end here--on the contrary, there's a _whole_ lot more to be done ... 

# In Maintenance:
## Automation:
 - Automate release notes on master & nightly
 - Automate documentation on master & nightly
 - Dependabot automation everywhere
## Packaging:
 - Automatic conda deployment on nightly
 - Direct conda packaging (without conda-forge)?
## Issue Management:
 - Automate issue labels
## Branch Management:
 - Automatic code coverage reports on pull requests and commits
 - Automate merge conflict resolutions for master→nightly
 - Automate merge conflict resolutions for nightly→master
# In Development:
## Compartments:
 - Vaccinated
 - Severe
 - Mild
 - Immune
 - Asymptomatic
 - Quarantined
## Model Types:
 - Cluster
 - Probabilistic
 - Monte-Carlo Simul
 - Large Area Simul
## Small Updates:
 - **Anything?**
## Major Changes:
 - Demographic modeling within compartments
 - More information on integrate()
     - inflection points
     - extrema
     - herd immunity markers
 - Pre-built support for geographic modeling
## Integrations:
 - Live COVID-19 data
 - Live national cases data
 - Live city/county data
# In Simulations:
## Small-Scale
 - Use spatial models get to accurate small-scale predictions
 - Implement in large cities:
     - San Francisco
     - London
     - Tokyo
     - New York
     - Mexico City
     - Mumbai
     - Add an open-source platform for more cities to be added
 - Build a web dashboard
## Large-Scale
 - Add large-scale modeling to CLI
 - Implement a Cluster model to simulate travel across major hotspots
 - Get a geographic model ready for world mapping
## Reproducable
 - **CLI!**
